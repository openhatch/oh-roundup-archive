     <p>Often your changes will involve more than one file, so it makes sense to submit all of those changes in one shot, especially if the changes depend on one another.  The <code>-r</code> option to diff makes it take two directories and compare their contents file-by-file, so you can keep one untouched copy of the project and one copy that you make your modifications to, then diff them with the <code>-r</code> option and get all of your changes in one convenient blob.</p>

     <p>Sometimes you might have to apply a patch that affects more than one file.  The patch program can tell what parts of the patch apply to what files by examining the headers, but you might need to help it out by giving the <code>-p</code> option to tell it how many levels of directories to ignore so it finds the correct files to patch.</p>

     <p>When you are submitting changes to a project, you will need to run diff to create a patch that you can submit.  Large patches can be stored in files and attached to whatever medium you use to submit the patch, but since this patch will be short, it can be included inline in the message.  So instead of uploading the patch in a file, your mission will be to make your patch and copy and paste it into the box below.</p>
