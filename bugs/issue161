    <pre>Part of the original issue here stems from a terminology issue that is being
fixed in <a href="issue371">issue371</a>. However, as per the discussion below, it would certainly be
useful to have a link between a tracker that we import from, and the projects
that it tracks bugs for.

IRC discussion:
21:51 paulproteus      jmaister: re: <a href="http://cl.ly/2s25290F452N0i0N223s">http://cl.ly/2s25290F452N0i0N223s</a> -- I
would also love a link you can go to that just lists the bug trackers (if any)
for your project
21:51 paulproteus      Then the sidebar at <a href="http://openhatch.org/+project/Amarok">http://openhatch.org/+project/Amarok</a>
(for example) would link there
21:51 paulproteus      It could even say, "No bug trackers listed for this
project. Do you want to add one?"
21:52 jmaister         That makes perfect sense
21:52 pythonian4000    paulproteus, that would probably directly tying a project
to the tracker(s) that supply bugs for it.
21:53 pythonian4000    s/probably/require
21:53 paulproteus      Well, the tracker should have (IMHO) a ForeignKey to a
project, yeah.
21:53 jmaister         isn't that a good thing?
21:53 pythonian4000    paulproteus, I would say the other way around.
21:53 paulproteus      That's good enough for the simple case, and we can worry
about the non-simple case later.
21:53 paulproteus      pythonian4000: Right, of course -- the other way
21:54 pythonian4000    It is much more likely that a tracker supply multiple
projects than a project have multiple trackers.
21:54 jmaister         It could even be a limitation, not being able to add
trackers for nonexisting projects
21:54 pythonian4000    jmaister, when we add trackers at present for
non-existing projects, it auto-creates them.
21:54 jmaister         right
21:55 pythonian4000    E.g. if a tracker ties bugs to project names based on the
"component" field, and a bug appears under a new component, a new project is
created.
21:55 pythonian4000    (This is governed by the bug_project_name_format field.)
21:55 jmaister         Auto complete for project name would be cool though.
Makes people sure they spell the project right
21:56 pythonian4000    jmaister, see <a href="issue161">issue 161</a> as well.
21:56 sufjan           04Bug <a href="https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue161">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue161</a> - title: In
mysite/customs/models.py we use "project_name" when instead we should ForeignKey
to a Project, creator: paulproteus, assignedto: pythonian4000, milestone:
0.11.03, status: chatting
21:56 paulproteus      jmaister: I think the common user experience should be
that they come from the project page, fwiw, at which point it's already filled in
21:56 jmaister         paulproteus: You rock at making sense today!
21:56 pythonian4000    +1 jmaister
21:56 jmaister         (for all I know you probably always do)
21:56 paulproteus      Yay a good day.
21:58 jmaister         Ok, so the /customs/ is for specially interested people.
It's the edit/add page and implementation with project page that should have
focus. Right?
21:58 pythonian4000    I agree. The whole reason I started this implementation
was to make it easier for people to add new trackers and edit existing ones.
21:59 jmaister         So do we need /customs/ at all? Can't we just directly
implement this with the project?
21:59 paulproteus      foxfirefey: <a href="http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/272059.html">http://foxfirefey.dreamwidth.org/272059.html</a>
is totally good.
21:59 foxfirefey       Aw, kitten.
22:00 foxfirefey       He is a good kitten.
22:02 pythonian4000    jmaister, I put it in /customs/ originally because of the
way the codebase was layed out.
22:03 pythonian4000    I.e. /search/ is implemented in mysite.search, /people/
is implemented in mysite.profile, /+projects/ is implemented in mysite.project etc.
22:03 paulproteus      I would suggest /+bugtrackers/ for a URL prefix
22:04 pythonian4000    s/bugtrackers/bugimporters/I'm correcting terminology
during asyncification
22:05 paulproteus      pythonian4000: For the user, though, seems like they're
adding a bug tracker, no?
22:06 pythonian4000    True...
22:06 pythonian4000    Yes, that is true.
22:06 * pythonian4000  is happy with that.
22:08 jmaister         Sorry for being ambigous (?) but what I meant was: Can
the bugtrackers be a subimplementation of a project, or is it so that a tracker
can belong to several projects?
22:09 jmaister         *ambiguous
22:09 pythonian4000    jmaister, a tracker can belong to several projects.
22:09 jmaister         Engrish is hard
22:09 jmaister         well, that settles it
22:09 paulproteus      &lt;jmaister&gt; i quit
22:09 pythonian4000    E.g. KDE or Gnome bug trackers, which services many
Products or Components.
22:10 jmaister         paulproteus: :P
22:11 pythonian4000    Or OLPC and Sugar trackers, which are OSs and so their
various components are separated out into separate projects.
22:11 pythonian4000    ^ On ones like those, <a href="issue328">issue 328</a> will be useful.
22:11 sufjan           04Bug <a href="https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue328">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue328</a> - title:
Projects should have separate URL/identifying and display names, creator:
pythonian4000, assignedto: pythonian4000, milestone: 0.11.03, status: chatting
22:12 paulproteus      Since we're talking about me whipping up the backend in a
day, I would be okay with "for now" only handling single-bug-tracker projects.
22:12 pythonian4000    So that the horribly non-descript in-tracker names can be
kept for the URLs and something else can be displayed.
22:12 paulproteus      (FWIW)
22:12 paulproteus      It's important to design the beautiful dream, too, so by
all means I think this conversation is good.
22:14 pythonian4000    FWIW the only one that properly works is Google, which is
by definition one-tracker-per-project.
22:14 paulproteus      But for now, I think that we can just add a note in the
UI saying "If this is for &gt;1 project, then, uh, add a note on this wiki page"
22:14 pythonian4000    Trac is unimplemented (but as it is the first importer I
am asyncing that will change very soon) and Bugzilla is... well, Bugzilla =D
22:15 pythonian4000    paulproteus, eventually I would hope that the following
would happen:
22:16 pythonian4000    * several projects exist that happen to have the same
tracker (and by chance have the exact same name as in the tracker ^_^)
22:16 pythonian4000    * one project uses this new link to add the tracker,
adding queries that cover the other projects as well.
22:17 pythonian4000    * The importer ties new Bugs for the other projects to
those projects correctly (as is the case currently as long as naming is correct)
22:17 pythonian4000    * Something ties the tracker to the other existing
projects, so their "Add your bug tracker" links now change to point at the same
bug tracker that the first project added.</pre>

    <pre>&lt;pythonian4000&gt; paulproteus, I disagree. What about e.g. Sugar where the project
name is not what is used for the bug (bug_project_name_format defines what
Project will be used)
&lt;paulproteus&gt; doing that column lengthening now
&lt;paulproteus&gt; pythonian4000: oh...
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Then it's a "Bug tracker name".
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Except when it's not, yargle.
&lt;paulproteus&gt; I think we should "for now" only support bug trackers that *do*
foreignkey to a project, in the web interface.
&lt;paulproteus&gt; I know that means we don't get to move GNOME Love in, for example,
but really one-project-per-bug-tracker is the common case.
&lt;pythonian4000&gt; So that's only ones that have {project} under
bug_project_name_format
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Once we focus that way, we can also simplify the form, and then we
can have a different, more complex form for the multiproject case.
-*- paulproteus nods
&lt;paulproteus&gt; One easy way to do that is to actually have both be stored in the
same table.
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Since the object supports both.
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Oh, in which case you need project_name... well make it
bug_tracker_name, then, and create a ForeignKey(Project) that can be null...
&lt;paulproteus&gt; And for single-project bug trackers, we auto-generate the
bug_tracker_name
&lt;paulproteus&gt; (see *this* is code review -- should have given it to you earlier :P)
&lt;paulproteus&gt; But it only makes sense as I imagine actually using it, like you
are now
&lt;pythonian4000&gt; Well I
&lt;pythonian4000&gt; 've looked through bugtrackers/bugzilla.py and there is actually
only a few trackers that use the project name as the bug_project_name
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Hmm. I guess that's because most Bugzilla projects are complex.
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Like, "you wouldn't set up Bugzilla if you had only one project
because Bugzilla is such a bear"
&lt;pythonian4000&gt; quite a few use {component} or {product}, and there are also
ones that have their own special methods for determinig what the name is (which
I was originally going to leave as special cases)
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Hmm... I see what you mean.</pre>
