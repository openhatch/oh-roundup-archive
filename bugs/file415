> command line, in the directory containing both patch_file and the original file. This command says "use the patch program to apply the diff in patch_file to a file in the current 
> directory". You can read more about the patch program in its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">"man page"</a> or type "man patch" in terminal.  </p>
