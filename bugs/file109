 # This file:
 # 1. Provides metadata about the openhatch codebase. This metadata creates a Python "package". This is done by the call to the setup() function -- for example, the "name" parameter sets the name of the package.
 # 2. In doing so, it declares the most urgent dependencies without which the code will not function. That is done through the "install_requires" parameter to setup().
