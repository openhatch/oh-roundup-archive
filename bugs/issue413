Is it okay if I try to re-work your tests so they work, and ship them during 
0.11.07? If so I will try to. Otherwise I will push this to 0.11.09 and see if 
you or someone else has bandwidth for it.

Let us know on the bug! I don't want to take it away if you're hacking on it or 
having fun with the plan of hacking on it in the future.</pre>

    <pre>On self.client vs client: The only important thing is that you make sure that the 
Django test client object comes from the login_with_client() function.

I *think* that there's a built-in self.client that is not logged-in, so it can be 
confusing.

That's my recollection off the top of my head, and it's what I was thinking when 
I wrote that comment.

    <pre>Hi Paul,

Asheesh asked me to have a look at this. It looks like a bunch of this conversation happened on 
IRC, which makes it hard for me to understand the state in this thread, but here's at least some 
feedback:

&gt; 2. Q: Why _should_ I handle the validation differently? Why is it sub-optimal?

It's sub-optimal because we shouldn't roll our own way of validating e-mail addresses that 
penalizes addresses containing certain keywords when there are existing, correct ways of validating 
e-mail addresses.

&gt; really what is stopping someone typing in _any_ valid email address?

The question to ask, then, is if you actually care about verifying what `git config user.email` is set 
to. You're right -- we can never know that they are using their correct address, and if that's the only 
valuable test then we just shouldn't test it and move on.

&gt; So why are you telling me... "I would also assert that the mission step hasn't been
&gt; successfully completed, or some other deeper check."  when the actual test _is_
&gt; asserting that the mission step hasn't been completed? eg:
&gt; "self.assertFalse(controllers.mission_completed(paulproteus, 'git_config'))" @
&gt; line #71.

I think Asheesh just didn't see in the moment that this function was called from a test that does 
make that check.

Paul: thanks a ton for all the work you've been doing on OpenHatch. I'm sorry you are getting 
frustrated with the back and forth of reviews, but stick with it. Also, you might find it satisfying to 
work on some smaller tickets for a bit, for the satisfaction of closing out a bunch without so much 
back and forth.

I'll keep this in review so Asheesh can comment on Q1, which seems to have been discussed on IRC. 
`self.client` is used exclusively over a local `client` in mysite/missions/git/tests.py, so I don't 
understand Asheesh's comment either (but I also only skimmed the file).</pre>

    <pre>So in trying to correct the problems that you have pointed out, I'm getting
really, really confused...

1. Q: What's the difference between current self.client.post() and client.post()
- Hasn't everybody else used it?
   ** self.cient is the result of self.login_with_client() @ line #27

2. Q: Why _should_ I handle the validation differently? Why is it sub-optimal?
  ** Ok, I get your point that my tests are gonna fail somebodies valid email
address, but really what is stopping someone typing in _any_ valid email address? 
  ** It's not like we're doing a double-opt-in sign-up here (but maybe we should
be?).
  ** Hey, at least once they do type in a invalid email they are told what's
wrong with it!
  ** I also have tested the functions I created manually and not just with the
unit test.

3. Q:  This isn't a test by itself. right? --&gt; def
email_address_is_rejected(self, email_address): 
   So why are you telling me... "I would also assert that the mission step
hasn't been
successfully completed, or some other deeper check."  when the actual test _is_
asserting that the mission step hasn't been completed? eg:
"self.assertFalse(controllers.mission_completed(paulproteus, 'git_config'))" @
line #71.

4. Q: Maybe you were having a bad day when you reviewed this patch?

For me to take the time to get patches corrected and then have another set of
hoops to jump through is really quite depressing, but then again, thanks heaps
for taking the time to review all these git mission patches!!</pre>

    <pre>I can't accept the "git config" tests yet because of this:

+    def test_do_git_description_mission_incorrectly(self):
+        self.assertFalse(self.email_address_is_rejected('<a href="mailto:paulproteus@pathi.local">paulproteus@pathi.local</a>'))

You seem to assert that <a href="mailto:paulproteus@pathi.local">paulproteus@pathi.local</a> should *not* be rejected
(assertFalse + the method name). That strikes me as incorrect; it should *be*
rejected.

Also, in "def email_address_is_rejected", checking the status code is a good
first step, but I would also assert that the mission step hasn't been
successfully completed, or some other deeper check.

Also, your test is kind of messy: You will reject any email address that has
"host" or "local" in it, but that means you'll reject "<a href="mailto:asheesh@mywebhost.com">asheesh@mywebhost.com</a>"
(for example) and "<a href="mailto:asheesh@localtv.com">asheesh@localtv.com</a>". As I think this through, I wonder: can
you just use the Django built-in EmailField to do the validation part? See also
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/fields/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/fields/</a>

I would suggest that you extract the email checking functionality into a
different function (probably, make it part of the def clean_email() in the
Django form you're using -- and actually, if you make it an EmailField, you can
use Django's built-in email checking)... actually, it *is* already an email
field! Hmm.

I would suggest you rewrite your email-validity-checks to use the Form class,
rather than the Django view, so that you can just straightforwardly check if the
form validation will accept e.g. pathi.local.

Also, in the template, rather than passing HTML in from the Python code, you
could just take the string the Python passes in and surround it as necessary
with HTML. For example, instead of

{{ var|safe|escape }}

maybe

&lt;strong&gt;{{ var|safe|escape }}&lt;/strong&gt;

Disabling the built-in Django escaping is something I don't like doing lightly,
but if in this case you need it and you know it's a safe thing to do, that's okay.

You're on the right track, and your git commit message is way clearer and easier
to read than they used to be!</pre>

    <pre>Hi Paul,

I think I can see some things that are going wrong here. But first of all, can
you *please* submit your work in smaller fragments? For example, the fixes to
about_git.html don't have to be in the same massive commit as these other changes.

If you create smaller commits, then you can feel happy about the smaller pieces
of work that are definitely correct, but moreover I can deploy them
independently of other work that is not yet ready.

If you need help with the git tools in order to make smaller commits, I am quite
happy to provide it. It's quite possible to take an existing commit and separate
it out into different commits, and that would make both of our lives easier.

Okay, as for this test: here's what I said on IRC last night:

&lt;paulproteus&gt; I suspect self.client is not logged in
&lt;paulproteus&gt; use client = self.login_with_client()
&lt;paulproteus&gt; then client.post()
&lt;paulproteus&gt; Times like these, I often do 'print response' in the tests, to see
what it is

Have you tried doing 'print response' to see what exactly you're getting? You
said you're getting an HTTP 302; that's a redirect. That either means that the
view is asking the "client" to log in, or that the POST submission succeeded
without error.

In general, don't use self.client. Use a local variable in your test called
"client" that you get as a result of calling self.login_with_client().

Also, you have some English style issues: You wrote, "Now let's get Git setup"
but (for American English, at least) it should be "Now let's get Git set up".

Some other issues: In the patch, I see a change to the indenting of the
HttpResponseRedirect at the end of "def resetrepo". Why change the indenting?
You also seem to be mixing tabs and spaces, which is generally bad news for
Python code. Please just use spaces.

<a href="http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/CodingStandards">http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/CodingStandards</a> has some
generally high-quality code style guidelines. 

You're on the right track. I think that if you work to answer my questions about
logging the user in, you can get this finished. Let me know how it goes.</pre>

    <pre>I have created a new step in the About Git page, as needed - renamed About Git

This git_config is #13, which will conflict with the bash mission index #13.

I'm also not sure about the validation - I have setup the form with a EmailField,
in the new ConfigForm. 
I thought this would be enough validation, but I'm not sure.

    <pre>The patch here needs some work, but it's getting there. Here's what I think needs 
being changed:

* You use em dashes, rather than hyphens, in the "git config --global" parts of the 
docs. It seems that that is live right now, so I realize I should have caught those 
earlier, but these commits should really fix that. (If you don't see what I mean, 
try copy-pasting what you said.)

* A default email address should be <a href="mailto:me@example.com">me@example.com</a> (example.com is actually 
reserved for this use; see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2606.txt</a> )
 the "next" link 

* I would prefer, slightly, that we actually validate that the user has configured 
things in a reasonable way. Like asking them to paste the output of 'git config --
global user.email' and making sure it has an @ sign in it. But I guess if we make 
the experience super clear, we don't *have* to do that.

Those are my thoughts; let me know if I missed something.</pre>
