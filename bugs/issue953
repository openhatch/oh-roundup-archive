    <pre>Fair enough. I see two paths here, looking for thoughts on both:

1. Filter out bugs that have a patch attached *and* are do not have a
status 'needs testing'.

Pro: This gives us bugs for which a patch has already been written,
and openhatch contributors can test that patch, and possibly update
the bug with the fact that it is working.

Con: There *could* be an implicit assumption that the person testing
the bug patch also is code-reviewing it, for instance the bug that
ehashman quoted (<a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue1100942">http://bugs.python.org/issue1100942</a>) seems to combine
reviews and testing. This may create more noise for new contributors.

2. Totally filter out any bugs with a patch attached, which would
probably exclude all bugs that have the status 'needs testing' (since
presumably a patch is always attached that would be used for said
testing).

Pro: This would restrict the importer to get only those bugs which are
open and have no patch and that no one is currently working on. This
means that new contributors would always see only "fresh" bugs.

Con: We might be ignoring some low-hanging fruit of bugs in stage
'needs review' with small patches attached, which could easily be
tested by new contributors.

I'd suggest going with the first option initially, if possible (to be
more conservative about the number of bugs we cut out), and then
revisit the issue if we still think the imported bugs look too noisy.

&gt;
&gt; The listed bug's status is now "needs patch", which in <a href="issue906">issue 906</a> would still be

&gt; However, it may be problematic to exclude issues that have patches attached---if
