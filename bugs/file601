<br/>Universal life insurance (UL) is flexible life insurance coverage that allows you to design the coverage in a myriad of different ways. The death benefit and premium payment may be altered following the policy is in effect. But universal life insurance comes with some drawbacks. Make sure that you realize fully the way the coverage works and whether or not you really need this type of policy, before you buy an UL policy.
<br/>Premiums and Cash Value
<br/>A UL coverage is driven by its premiums and cash value. Premiums are paid into a cash value account. The insurance company subsequently takes out the costs related to the death benefit. The cash surrender value is subsequently invested in to either a fixed interest account, mutual funds, or perhaps a proprietary equity indexing strategy controlled by the insurance company. How your cash value is invested depends completely on the particular contract you buy.
<br/>Death Benefit
<br/>Your death benefit may be level or raising. A level death benefit can be a death benefit that won't change for nearly all of your lifetime. The cash value account builds up against the value of the death benefit, therefore lowering the amount of death benefit you buy with time. This, subsequently, reduces the cost of insurance with time, assuming the costs while in the policy usually do not change. A rising death benefit earns cash value in addition to the death benefit. The death benefit amount remains the same and therefore the costs of insurance consistently rise with time. The hope is that the cash surrender value will make enough interest to counter these rising costs. Should they don't, then your cash value account may be depleted as more and more money is employed to finance the death benefit. <a href='http://universallifeinsurers.com/'>UniversalLifeInsurers.com</a> 
<br/>Effects
<br/>Universal Life contracts allow you to really change the contract provisions anytime. You may change from a level death benefit to an rising death benefit or an rising death benefit to your level death benefit. Additionally, you might change the amount of death benefit you buy. On top of that, if there is enough cash value to support the death benefit premiums may be raised within certain limits, and reduced or removed.
<br/>Consideration
<br/>They also may give a false sense to you of security, while UL contracts are flexible. The costs of the policy are predicated on assumptions created by the insurance company. If these assumptions turn out to become wrong, the costs could increase drastically. Your premiums could rise considerably over time. Should you be willing to take the threat inherent while in the policy, then this coverage class gives you the most versatility of any type of life insurance available on the market. It is ideal for times when you need to possess total control over your insurance plan. In the event you anticipate needing distinct amounts of insurance throughout your lifetime, this coverage provides the ability to you to change your coverage without purchasing another policy. </p></body></html>
