-Debian stable does not currently (Sept 1 2010) have the necessary packages, you must either run Debian testing/unstable or use apt-pinning.  See below for how to install on Debian stable.

 On some Operating Systems you may not need (or be able) to install all of the above packages, depending on what comes prebuilt with Python as default. If you do find a package for any of the above for your system, you should install it.
 
 The other dependencies (like Django) are handled by "buildout", so keep reading patiently and we'll get to that.

-[Apt pinning](http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html) is required, once it's configured it lets you install packages from testing (and unstable).
-This is required to be able to get the packages that exist in testing but don't exist or aren't up to date in stable.

-Note this is not the same command as was used above, there are two differences.  First and most importantly, the `-t testing` argument.  This tells aptitude to install the testing version of the package, and try to meet any dependencies from testing.  Second is that this time I used aptitude instead of apt-get.  I use aptitude over apt-get especially when the system is configured to use apt pinning because aptitude is better at resolving dependencies.

-This is normal, it's just checking with you before applying the solution its chosen to resolve that dependency or broken package.  Press `y` and hit enter to continue to the prompt you are familiar with from apt-get [then press `y` and hit enter again].
-From here, you can go back up to the Run Buildout section above and continue from there.

 ## Testing ##
 
 As you make changes to the source code, you'll want to run unit tests to make sure that everything is still hunky-dory. To run all tests, except the rather slow tests in the `customs` app, run this command:
