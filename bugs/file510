Subject: [PATCH] Fix a bug where the recursive patch mission sends you to the
 wrong place

To reproduce:

* Visit http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_patch
  and submit the correct answer (3)

* Notice that you get redirected to somewhere *other* than
  http://openhatch.org/missions/diffpatch/recursive_patch

(Replace openhatch.org with 127.0.0.1:8000 for local dev
instances, obviously.)
