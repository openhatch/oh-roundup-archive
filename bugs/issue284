   <td colspan="4" class="content">
    <pre>Wow, becdot, these changes are comprehensive!

I have a few bits of feedback. First, general; then, specific.

General feedback:

* Overall, the quality of your changes is outstanding.

* You did a great, comprehensive job of looking for all relevant references to 'weekly' in the 
code and adjusting them.

* Great job writing a migration; this is essential, so thank you for taking care of it.

* Considering all the above, I can see that this is the longest patch ever for a so-called 
"bitesize" task. So, thank you for tackling an issue like that!

* You mentioned having an empty set of Projects in your local database. The two ways around that 
are, assuming you can run the site and view a development instance via 'python manage.py 
runserver', (1) create a new project in your personal profile on your account on your 
development instance or (2) use 'python manage.py shell_plus' to get a Django/Python shell, then 
call Project.create_dummy() (defined in mysite/search/models.py). That will create a project 
object you can check out on the web. (A variant of this is to create a new Project object like: 
Project.objects.create(name='sample').)

* If you want, you could submit a pull request on Github. It will probably be easier to do the 
review that way -- it's easier on Github than here, and it's easy on Github to comment on 
individual lines.

* It's always great if you can pop into #openhatch and ask any questions you have as you work 
through bugs.

* The 0001 patch is really long. Possibly, you could split up the changes there into lots of 
separate commits; then, git format-patch would export each commit as a separate patch file.

Is it a good idea to split it up? Usually I'm all for more commits, but in this case, I'm on the 
fence about this. On one hand, in favor of splitting it into pieces, it's hard to review as-is 
because it is so long. On the other hand, many of the changes are dependent on each other. If 
you wanted to split it up, here are some segments that seem to be that they could be separate. 
(1) Rename the daily_email__list_of_people.html template and related templates, fixing up the 
corresponding view function. (2) Make the rest of the changes in 0001. (3) Create your 
migration, like you do in 0002.

For now, I'd say, the separation is fine as-is, but in the future, I'd warn the reviewer in the 
patch submission that it touches a lot of files, and give a rationale; for example, "This 
touches a lot of files because the 'weekly' assumption shows up a lot of places."

Oh, actually, as I write out that rationale, I realize another way to make more, easier-to-read 
commits: First, do a a commit (or maybe a few small commits) to remove references to how often 
the email gets sent from a lot of places. (To name two examples of this to illustrate the point, 
changing mysite.base.views.test_weekly_email_re_projects to 
mysite.base.views.test_email_re_projects and simply removing "weekly" from comments, rather than 
changing it to "daily".) These commits can stand on their own; they're code cleanups, and the 
tests will all pass unmodified (except for maybe truly trivial changes for the filename). (In 
general, if you rename a file *and* modify it, it's harder to review; it's way easier to do a 
rename of a file first, and then a change in a later commit, because then git can detect the 
rename and show that to me, the reviewer.) Then, in a separate commit, now that the word 
'weekly' or constants like ONE_WEEK only appear where needed, you would change the logic and/or 
move code around. That would be a small, surgical change probably; very easy to review.

(The fact that you have to change all these variable names and filenames just to make a small, 
surgical change is actually an indication of poor code quality in the OpenHatch codebase. I'm to 
blame for those choices, so please excuse my naivety in 2010.)

Wow, that all came out more long-winded than I thought. I hope it makes sense; I'm quite 
available on IRC (which I'm faster at) to chat more.

Again, the extraction into smaller commits isn't necessarily a show-stopper.

Specific feedback:

* In the migration, you delete the old column and create the new column, but that means any 
existing preferences will get deleted. It's better to have three (!) migrations: one to create 
the new column, another to copy the data, and a third to delete the old column. More info here: 
<a href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part3.html#data-migrations">http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part3.html#data-migrations</a>

* git warns me about "whitespace errors" in send_daily_emails.py -- on a few lines, there are ' 
' (space) characters at the end of the line, and git doesn't like that. It's just a warning, and 
it's okay to ignore it, but it's helpful to clean those up. Since your changes involve a rename, 
it's best to do the rename in a separate commit from changing this sort of whitespace issue. 
(You could even fix those whitespace problems in a commit *before* the rename commit.) The 
reason git warns about this is that if two files disagree about end-of-line space characters, it 
can prevent git from cleanly merging changes sometimes. (That, the spaces just don't do 
anything, so might as well get rid of them.) (It's easy for me to see them when I do 'git diff -
-color'.)

* You add a "TODO" question in the test suite: "Do we need to set seven_days_ago to yesterday 
since emails are now sent daily?" My answer is that yes, we need to test the new functionality. 
Make sure all the constants are adjusted for the new functionality. Luckily, you do test the new 
functionality below.

Other things that occur to me as I read this code:

* The push_to_end_of_list() function in send_daily_emails.py is a pretty silly function. But I'm 
to blame for that. What was I thinking?

* We (the authors of this code in 2010) shouldn't have put _weekly_ into all those variable 
names and filenames.

* It seems that the automated tests in the "profile" app already fail, before your changes. 
That's on us, the maintainers, not on you. I'll see if I can fix that shortly, because normally 
I would ask you to make sure that the test suite passes with your changes, but if it doesn't 
pass now, figuring out if the failures are from your code or from our old code is a lot to ask.

Conclusion:

Right now, before I can merge these patches, I'd need a fixed migration that retained the old 
data. If you want to do the code cleanup above and make more commits that replace 0001, that'd 
be fine too (though it's okay if not). Additionally, we should come to a decision about the TODO 
item and remove the TODO note, one way or the other.

Sorry it took me a day to get to reviewing it. I will review follow ups faster, and also shorter 
patches I can always review faster. If you need clarification or help with any of the points 
above, just let me know. (IRC is usually faster, but responses here are fine too.)

Thank you for submitting these changes! I'm looking forward to seeing them in a mergeable state, 
and then deploying them!</pre>

    <pre>Hi Asheesh,

thank you for your e-mail. As I got stuck on the buildout process I removed
myself from the bug. As of now I don't have much time to take a look with
it, but really, thanks for the heads up. When I have some spare time again
I'll try to build it out, and when it works I'll search for a new bug to try
to fix. :)

Cheers,

    <pre>I do think this is bitesized. It probably requires writing some high-quality 
English text and a little (probably very little) Python code.

To tackle this, here is what you'd do:

* Read mysite/profile/management/commands/profile_daily_tasks.py
* Read mysite/profile/management/commands/send_weekly_emails.py

One thing you should know: On the server, we just run the profile_daily_tasks 
management command. It runs daily, and if it has been long enough, it runs the 
weekly email sending.

You should, at that point, understand how the weekly notifications get sent.

(If not, just ask us on #openhatch .)

Then you'll need to change it so that they run daily. Any set of changes that you 
make to achieve that are fine; I'm not super picky about the implementation. (For 
example, you might remove the send_weekly_emails management command and make its 
body part of the profile_daily_tasks file. Actually, that seems good; then make 
the daily notification sending be a method on the Command class in that file.)

Make sure to update the test suite, too.

Then, submit a patch!</pre>

    <pre>Hi Asheesh,

Thanks for the check-in. Right now I'm busy with my day job. If this is an
urgent bug, I'm happy to relinquish it to someone else.

Best
Joshua

&gt; Hey ablian,
&gt;
&gt; Let me know how this is progressing for you! Recently people have reported
&gt; problems getting buildout to work properly, so I want to make sure things
&gt; are
&gt; going well for you.
&gt;
&gt; If you have questions about how to find the relevant code, and how it all
&gt; runs,
&gt; then I can also answer those -- either ask on this bug, or on the [Devel]
&gt; list,
&gt; or on the #openhatch IRC channel.
