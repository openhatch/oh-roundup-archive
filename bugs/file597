<br/>The maturity date of an insurance policy denotes the date of which the policy isn't any longer in effect. In term life policies, the policy just ends at this date. In whole-life policies, a specified amount is paid by the insurance company to the insured if he is still alive in the maturity date. In most insurance contracts, shifting the maturity date is impossible. You can, however, request a fresh policy or control the policy's value. This can often accomplish the same objectives you wanted to accomplish by shifting the maturity date.
<br/>Benefit from a policy's grace period
<br/>Each state has its own law that enables you to terminate an insurance policy in the event you change your mind after signing the paperwork. In case you are still within that window, you may call off the policy at no fee, then start again to reset the maturity date. <a href='http://universallifeinsurers.com/'>www.universallifeinsurers.com</a> 
<br/>Request a fresh policy from your insurance broker
<br/>This means, you cancel your present policy, and set up a fresh one with a distinct maturity date. Remember that, since your insurance costs go up with each birthday, this strategy is barely viable during the first years of your policy.
<br/>Ask your broker about a policy extension
<br/>In some cases, insurance company policy enables an insured person if the existing policy had been cancelled by him to extend the period of an insurance deal without altering the price of the policy - - - or at a rate less than and requested a re issue. As a way to generate extra revenue, insurance providers sometimes provide this option in a limited window.
<br/>Make extra payments to the life-insurance account
<br/>This option is viable for numerous iterations of universal life insurance and whole life. Of course, this doesn't really change the maturity date of the coverage, however it will hasten the date of which the policy's value is what it would really be on the maturity date. This really resembles paying extra on a mortgage to be able to decrease your interest.
<br/>Sign up for a loan from the policy's value
<br/>This is just another option available only with whole life insurance and its own versions. Also like making extra payments, this really does not really alter the maturity date. It will, however, push back the point at which the insurance account would theoretically achieve maturity value.
<br/>Cash-out the policy
<br/>With this specific option, you terminate the policy thoroughly and receive a payment for the cash-value which has collected thus far. Again, this really does not alter the maturity date---but it does meet the aims some folks could have had for making that change.
<br/>Accept the value of the policy
<br/>Below this option, you cease making payments to the policy, however a life-insurance coverage remains in effect in a lesser value than the original deal. Like other options, this really does not technically alter the maturity date. It can, however, meet a number of the objectives you might have for attempting to shift it. </p></body></html>
