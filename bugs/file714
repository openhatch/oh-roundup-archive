<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<div style="float:right;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1hOhIyg.jpg"></div>
Garcinia cambogia contains a powerful extract called hydroxycitric acid or HCA extract. HCA extract has two weight loss properties, which are:
<br/><br/>
Appetite suppressant: HCA extract increases the secretion of a neurotransmitter called serotonin. Serotonin controls both mood and appetite and studies have shown that low levels of serotonin can cause serious food cravings.
<br/><br/>
By increasing the serotonin levels in your body, garcinia cambogia helps block food cravings and will eliminate your desire for unhealthy foods. This process is especially helpful for emotional eaters, which tend to eat during times of great stress or anxiety.
<br/><br/>
Fat blocker: HCA extract inhibits the production of an enzyme called citric lyase, which causes the body to convert carbohydrates into fat. By blocking this hormone, the liver stops producing fat and starts converting carbohydrates into usable energy.
<br/><br/>
This process also boosts the body’s natural metabolism, which is the rate at which we burn fat. By revving up your metabolism, garcinia cambogia can effectively help you burn fat faster.
<br/><br/>
<h2>Research and Clinical Studies</h2>
<div style="float:left;padding-right:10px;"><a href="http://garciniatv.com/go/free-trial-offer/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZBg582B.jpg"></a></div>
There have been several research studies on garcinia cambogia, which have been almost all been positive. Here are a few of the studies:
<br/><br/>
In a 12-week study, 89 adults were either given a high dose of garcinia cambogia extract or a placebo. After the four months were completed, participants were weighed and measured again. 
<br/><br/>
The garcinia cambogia group lost 2.9 more pounds than the placebo group but managed to lose a significantly more amount of fat. Garcinia users also saw a reduction in blood pressure and cholesterol.
In a second study, 60 participants were either given a 1,320mg dose of garcinia cambogia or a placebo. After two months, the garcinia cambogia group had lost an average of 14.0 pounds where as the placebo group had lost an average of 6.1 pounds.
<br/><br/>
The garcinia cambogia group also had no problems with their appetite whereas the placebo group had trouble sticking to the 1,200 calorie diet participants had to follow.
<br/><br/>
Finally, in a paper published in the Journal of Obesity, researchers evaluated about a dozen clinical trials and found that garcinia cambogia could help dieters lose about a dozen extra pounds over the course of 2-3 months.
<br/><br/>
