 <p>Git is a version control system (VCS) created by Linux Torvalds,  the creator of the Linux kernel. Git is known as a 'distributed” VCS, or DVCS. This means that each user's copy of the code is a fully working repository and includes all previous commit information.  Rather than connecting to a remote server as you would with Subversion or CVS, users can work productively offline, choosing to later sync their changes with a remote repository or create a patch file.</p>
 
-<p>The purpose of this mission is to teach you how to clone a remote repository, make changes to a file, check them into your local copy, and finally create a patch file.</p>
