     <h2>Diffing entire directories</h2>
     <p>Often your changes will involve more than one file, so it makes sense to submit all of those changes in one shot, especially if the changes depend on one another.  The <code>-r</code> option to diff makes it take two directories and compare their contents file-by-file, so you can keep one untouched copy of the project and one copy that you make your modifications to, then diff them with the <code>-r</code> option and get all of your changes in one convenient blob.</p>
     <p>Here is your mission:</p>

 <p>Most open source projects keep their code in a version control system (<abbr title="version control system">VCS</abbr>).  Subversion is a popular VCS for open source projects.  Subversion is a non-distributed VCS, meaning that there is a single central repository that all users and developers interact with.</p>
