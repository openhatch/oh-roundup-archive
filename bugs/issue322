    <pre>Hi Jessica,

Some last-minute feedback before I close this ticket.

* The second patch as submitted includes changes to mysite/profile/models.py that 
you don't seem to need.

* That patch adds some JavaScript code that we could probably move into a global 
.js file, since it occurs twice.

That's really all I have to say other than:

* This patch totally rules. I'm thrilled and relieved that you're choosing to 
work with us for as long as you do.

This patch is deployed.

(glyph, log in and take a look. We haven't done the "Attract contributors" side 
of the world yet. File bugs as appropriate.)</pre>

    <pre>Having a error because it's not a valid function is not nitpick. Thought I
tested the link. Sorry about that!

Also, sorry about the extra white space at the end. I turned on space
identifiers in Eclipse so hopefully cleaned up trails this time. 

If not, I can get them in version 11.05 probably.

Right-o.

Changed "Recommended people/collaborators" to be "Collaborators" if in a
project. If not, it's "Potential collaborators" which is randPeople(). Mentors
would be great for 11.05.

I didn't notice nudges and have put them back in. Nudge on mission and nudge on
bugs. AKA, if no missions, nudge text. If no tags, nudge text.

Mission status if in progress should be 11.05 (unless someone can do that cause
I'm out of time).

Yes, moved stuff around. I followed the mockup since it was agreed on but did a
little shuffling. Also, did the CSS a little differently so the boxes don't
float to fit. This means white space but means consistency as well.

Yes, to a better "Attract new contributors" page but I don't have extra time
today. Already behind on some other stuff :) Definitely agree that should be in
11.05. 

Whatever doesn't get in 11.04 will appear in a new bug to continue making the
logged in user landing pages more dynamic.

-------Edit-------
Changed a few things based on IRC feedback but there's a more recent screen shot:

missions, but wants to help one project

tweak on text):

    <pre>Hi Jessica,

A few thoughts as I review the patch:

* The changes to .gitignore should really be their own commit.

* Some of the changes you made make git complain about 'whitespace errors'. That 
usually means you ended a line with some " " (space) characters. git doesn't like 
that, in part because it can sometimes cause merge conflicts meaninglessly.

* I get a TemplateSyntaxError because mysite.missions.svn.views.about is not a 
valid function. It's mysite.missions.svn.views.main_page ; same with the tar 
view. (I fixed that locally when reviewing so the page would render.)

Nitpicking aside, some more meaningful comments:

* Wow, this is so good.

* "Recommended people" maybe should be "People you've collaborated with", since 
that's all it is for now, and it could be smaller, since it's not actually that 
exciting. Probably we should improve this to say, "People you should probably 
contact" and list prospective mentors!?!?!!? (*excited but timid gulp*)

* The text for if you haven't done the missions could maybe explain what the 
missions are, in case you don't know. We used to have a "Nudge" for missions on 
the old logged-in landing page; maybe you could use something like that?

* Also, it says: "I have helped: No projects listed yet." -- not true! This 
should be the list of projects that appear in my profile. You can nab this from 
mysite.models.Person.get_list_of_all_project_names() -- note that this method 
only gets the ones that are 'published', which I think is fine.

* Maybe the 'Projects' part of the page should move to the top half, since along 
with missions it's the most useful thing.

I presume you know the 'Attract new contributors' tab is mostly the same. I think 
we can add some things to it, if you're up for it:

* It maybe should link to projects you're a part of, particular show the ones 
that have wannahelpers.

* It should maybe provide a 'nudge' to fill out the project page, if it's blank.

* If one of the projects doesn't have any Bug objects associated with it, it 
could (for now) link to the wiki page about adding a bug tracker. (Soon, maybe 
later today, there'll be an in-site UI for that.)

I guess it does do all those things right now, in theory, but because it's the 
same as if I'm not logged in and it doesn't mention anything personal to me, I 
ignore the old links. That's the way my brain works, I guess. Maybe others' work 
similarly.

That's what I have for you. One more thing: this is *phenomenal*. It gives me so 
much hope for this website we have!</pre>

    <pre>I have ideas for 11.05 ;) Let's see. I did just completed missions. Recommended
people is slightly different because of the trapped white space looked funny.
Hope that's alright. "Attract" tab is basically the current not logged-in user
landing but no "Create a profile" box and no "Try it out!" link, of course.

It seems I can just do one file at a time so here are some screenshots. 

Patch is attached for review.

    <pre>Recommended people are, indeed, collaborators, if the user has any.

You could code up a way to check if which missions "new", but for now, I would
put together something ad-hoc. Maybe check for what missions have uncompleted
steps, and show all those?

The "Recent activity" is, I think, just the global site activity feed.

I think that we'll probably want to revisit the contents of these pages,
honestly, so I wouldn't spend much time focusing on getting what you show there
to be exactly right.

I would say that this ticket is really for the UI consistency -- tabs just like
when you're not logged in -- and we should later figure out the right things to
put on those pages.</pre>

    <pre>Are the "recommended people" the collaborators (if the logged in user has some). 
It looks like it since the 3 shown in the screen are all in OpenHatch. 

Do I need to code up a way to know which missions are "new"? 
missions/templates/main.html looks like missions are part of the template and not 
in the db, right? I see steps in missions_steps but don't see just missions.

What about "recent activity"? Maybe on the bottom left next to news like the no 
logged in user's version of the front page?</pre>
