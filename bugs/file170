well..i think stars not aligned for me... I initially thought &quot;South&quot; is some person or something..without realizing that the document is referring to the migration tool...so i have experimented with various debian versions from EC2 and getting different errors..but for now.. I have lost  the previous error details... .. I am sure.. it will ultimately work me....one of the error that can be improved in the document is that apt-get couldnt find python2.6-dev version... i had to compile 2.6 manually.. with zlib options..we should update the document if it is the case...<br>

Viv, could you pastebin (<a href="http://pastebin.com/" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/</a>) the<br>
output of the migration command? So that we can see<br>
what error you are getting.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that the error will be something to<br>
do with an index name being too long, as that has<br>
recently affected several people including myself<br>
(though the reason is unknown, as it was fine for a<br>
long time). If so then it is reasonably easy to fix.<br>
<br>
Also, the script that the README refers to is in the<br>
error message that South outputs, just above the stack<br>
trace - where it says something like &quot;You MAY be able<br>
to recover by executing the following:&quot;.<br>
