People in a hypnotic trance are typically very focused on one stimulus to the exclusion of others. <strong><a href="http://www.tiffanyjewelryseller.com/tiffany-necklaces-c-22.html">tiffany necklaces</a></strong> People in a hypnotic trance are also somewhat suggestible, although they are by no means unable to control themselves and continue to bear full responsibility for their actions.  <br><br><br><br>There are several ways to induce a hypnotic trance.  Some of the more popular ones include the hypnosis spiral, the use of an object that glitters such as a piece of jewelry or a gold watch, and progressive relaxation. <br><br><br><br>Hypnosis Spiral<br><br><br><br>As the title suggests, a hypnosis spiral is a constantly moving spiral pattern. <strong><a href="http://www.tiffanyjewelryseller.com/tiffany-bangles-c-19.html">discount tiffany bangle</a></strong> Hypnosis spirals are available on many websites dealing with trance induction.  Some of them are available for free download; others must be purchased.  Once you have obtained a hypnosis spiral, induce trance by having your subject keep his or her eyes on it for several minutes.  While the subject is doing this, you can deepen the trance by playing relaxing music or offering suggestions that the subject is becoming sleepy, that his or her limbs and eyelids are becoming heavy, etc. <strong><a href="http://www.tiffanyjewelryseller.com/tiffany-pendants-c-23.html">buy cheap tiffany pendats</a></strong><br><br><br><br>A hypnosis spiral can also be used to test a person's ability to be hypnotized.  Have your would-be subject watch the spiral for thirty seconds.  After that, have your subject look at the palm of his or her hand.  If the subject sees no abnormalities in the spiral or the hand, he or she will probably be quite difficult to hypnotize. <strong><a href="http://www.tiffanyjewelryseller.com/tiffany-earrings-c-17.html">tiffany earrings outlet</a></strong> On the other hand, the subject who sees the spiral start to change colors and sees an increase in size in his or her hand is probably quite suggestible and easy to hypnotize. <br><br><br><br>Bright Objects<br><br><br><br>Another way to induce trance is to hold a bright object, such as a sparkly piece of jewelry, just above the subject's eye level and tell the subject to keep his or her eyes on it.  Eventually, the eyes will become weary and the eyelids will become heavy.  The hypnotist then steps in with suggestions that the subject is feeling sleepy, cannot keep his or her eyes open, etc. <br><br><br><br>Progressive Relaxation<br><br><br><br>A final way to induce hypnotic trance, favored in the psychotherapeutic and medical community, is progressive relaxation.  Speaking in a calm, authoritative voice, the hypnotist instructs the subject to first tense, then relax, every major muscle group starting with the toes.  By the time the hypnotist reaches the muscles in the neck and face, the subject will be in a deep, relaxed trance. <br>. <br><br><a href="https://www.shopbando.com/blog"> Other About Tiffany Cuff Link Sale  blog </a><br><br><a href="http://www.jerryvines.com/blog/"> Tiffany Cuff Link Sale  </a><br><br><a href="http://www.etechmoney.com/my-account/1102-ymccademcki/photos.html"> About </a><a href="http://tiffanyjewelryseller.com">tiffanyjewelryseller.com</a> blog </p>'''.encode('utf-8')]
