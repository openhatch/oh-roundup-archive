<p>Sure thing.  I&#39;m away from the house for most of the day. But, I can gave a patch ready by tomorrow morning.  Thanks for the hint on the coding standards.  </p>

&gt; <br>&gt; Wow, on a glance that paatch looks totally great.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; A few quibbles about your use of whitespace: In comments, we&#39;ve used &quot;# <br>&gt; xyz&quot; not &quot;#xyz&quot; as you do (the difference is a space character). Also in <br>
&gt; templates we generally do {{ xyz }} not {{xyz}} (again, more space). If <br>&gt; you make those chanes as a patch on top of this, that&#39;d be swell.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I was hoping the project of achieving this could serve to help someone <br>
&gt; write a tutorial on doing this, so that there is a walkthrough on the wiki <br>&gt; of how to use South to add a column.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Writing up that doc is a separate issue. Once I&#39;m not on my phone, I&#39;ll <br>
&gt; give it a more thorough review (bit it looks fine now).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you need suggestions for what to chew on next, let me know!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; __________________________________________<br>&gt; Roundup issue tracker &lt;<a href="mailto:bugs@openhatch.org">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;<br>
