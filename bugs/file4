*sigh*<br><br>Visual representations of humans in heavily sociopolitically-laden contexts are easy to critique, no matter what you do.<br><br>As we talked about when I first made the dang graphic, my goal was to portray the FLOSS community as it is. Most FLOSS projects are not racially diverse or gender-balanced: they&#39;re heavily white, with Asians and Brazilians as the runners-up, and are at most 5% female. Given the graphic&#39;s sample size of four, including an Asian woman when neither of those attributes approach even close to 25% of the FLOSS community was already kinda tokenism. Unless we add (lots) more characters to the graphic, adding other minorities would be token, too.<br>
<br>Of course, no one except me seems to think she&#39;s Asian. Do people just by default read Asian characters as white unless they have buck teeth and slanted lines for eyes? I could (in theory) redraw her that way! Then people&#39;d really get it...and be (rightly) pissed off for a different reason. :P<br>
<br>So my questions:<br><br>What, exactly, do you think changing one of the OpenHatch doodles&#39; virtual melanin level from #fbe4d0 to #8e682d will accomplish?<br><br>Are we trying to represent (with a little wiggle room for aesthetic purposes) the FLOSS community as it is, or the FLOSS community as we wish it was?<br>
<br>If the latter, what on earth is the gender, age, weight, race, and coloration distribution of the &quot;ideal&quot; FLOSS community that I should be taking cues from?<br><br>-- Karen<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Mar 15, 2010 at 7:01 AM, Asheesh Laroia <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:bugs@openhatch.org">bugs@openhatch.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
