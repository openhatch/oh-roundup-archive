<div dir="ltr">loaddata is indeed an upstream thing. So we could file an issue there.<div><br></div><div>It might be worth profiling it -- where is all the time going? Is it being spent waiting on the database, or mostly spent parsing the *.json.gz file? If the parsing, maybe we can find a different format (the Scrapy &quot;jsonlines&quot; format is one of my favorite formats) and see if we can hack in support for that.</div>

We could make that a job in e.g. Jenkins.</div>
