Hi Asheesh,<div><br></div><div>Actually I initially created this patch using PyCharm and then realized that the patch was not git compatible, So I thought of work on it more and test the patch myself before sending for review/implementation, I communicated the same to Paul also.</div>
<div>     If you feel the patch is reasonably ok then I wont do more work on that, but the patch is verbatim implementation of pythonian4000 sample implementation, I am already ashamed of not investing enough time to solve it myself and it would be burden on me, if I take any credit for the implementation. All glory to pythonian4000.</div>
<div>      I will implement the changes you suggested and send the patch by Monday. Please let me know if there is anything else can be enhanced.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br></div><div>Vivek</div><div><br>

This patch looks good at a first glance!<br>
<br>
Actually, it looks really really great. I think this is the highest-quality patch<br>
I have seen for a first or second or third contribution. Here are some of the<br>
things you did right:<br>
<br>
* Extensive commenting<br>
* A test for the test suite right off the bat<br>
* Extremely reasonable use of Django signals<br>
* A completely proper migration<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sitting here muttering to myself, &quot;This is truly amazing.&quot; It&#39;s really good<br>
work.<br>
<br>
There are just a few things you should change. The first and most important one<br>
is the one palhmbs pointed out: You should submit your work as a git format-patch<br>
file. You should commit locally, then export it to a file.<br>
<a href="http://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches" target="_blank">http://openhatch.org/wiki/How_we_handle_patches</a> and the git training mission on<br>
the OpenHatch site explain how to do this.<br>
<br>
Code-wise:<br>
<br>
* Use logging.debug(), not print<br>
** (Using &quot;print&quot; in a WSGI context isn&#39;t good. See also<br>
<a href="http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/04/wsgi-and-printing-to-standard-output.html" target="_blank">http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/04/wsgi-and-printing-to-standard-output.html</a> )<br>
<br>
* Use a space after every comma<br>
** This is just a style thing, but it makes code more readable. For example, in<br>
the new get_hit_count_cache_key():<br>
<br>
        hit_count_cache_key = &quot;hcc_%s_%s&quot; %<br>
(hashlib.sha1(hcc_timestamp.__str__()).hexdigest(),hashed_query)<br>
<br>
would become<br>
<br>
        hit_count_cache_key = &quot;hcc_%s_%s&quot; %<br>
(hashlib.sha1(hcc_timestamp.__str__()).hexdigest(), hashed_query)<br>
<br>
Small change.<br>
<br>
* Always use consistent indenting, even for comment lines. Here:<br>
<br>
+    def get_or_create_cached_hit_count(self):<br>
+       # Get the cache key used to store the hit count.<br>
+        hit_count_cache_key = self.get_hit_count_cache_key()<br>
<br>
should be:<br>
<br>
+    def get_or_create_cached_hit_count(self):<br>
+        # Get the cache key used to store the hit count.<br>
+        hit_count_cache_key = self.get_hit_count_cache_key()<br>
<br>
Move that comment one space deeper in.<br>
<br>
* You have made the post_bug_save_delete_increment_hit_count_cache_timestamp()<br>
function be part of the WannaHelperNote class due to indenting it. You should<br>
undo the indenting so that it&#39;s not part of the class definition.<br>
<br>
Fix those, and moreover, resubmit it as a git format-patch file. Thanks for the<br>
work you&#39;ve done here!<br>
