       <p>That should apply the patch file. Open up <code>more-garlic.diff</code> in a text editor and read the patch file "headers". Pay special attention to the directory paths. The <code>-p1</code> says to ignore up through the first "/" in the paths in the patch headers when trying to find files to patch.</p>

 	 <p>One way to accomplish this is by running a command like <pre>patch -p0 &lt; patch_file</pre> from the command-line, in the directory containing both <code>patch_file</code> and the original file (replace <code>"patch_file"</code> with the actual name of the file you downloaded). This command says "use the patch program to apply the diff in <code>patch_file</code> to a file in the current directory". You can read more about the <code>patch</code> program in its <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/patch">man page</a> (or type <code>man patch</code> at the command-line).</p>
