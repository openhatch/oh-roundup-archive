 <p>Now that you have a copy of the repository, you can fix the problem before it spreads further.</p>
 <p>In most cases, especially when starting to contribute to an open source project, you will not have rights to commit directly to the code base. Your contributions will be sent to the project maintainers using a patch file.  This file contains the contents of your changes.  The maintainers can review your work and then merge the changes into the main project, when ready. Using these steps, you can give The Brain a patch containing your changes.  If he likes it, he'll commit it for you!</p>
