 This is what we do on Debian testing/unstable:

 Or the equivalent for your system. (It's important that you get Python 2.6 or greater -- some of the OpenHatch code depends on Python 2.6 or higher.)
 
 On some Operating Systems you may not need (or be able) to install all of the above packages, depending on what comes prebuilt with Python as default. If you do find a package for any of the above for your system, you should install it.
 
+Subversion is a dependency ONLY if expect to run unit tests. - See the section ## Testing ##
+
 The other dependencies (like Django) are handled by "buildout", so keep reading patiently and we'll get to that.
