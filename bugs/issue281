    <pre>Karen, you asked: what can wait for next month?

I'd say this one is something I'd really want to see:

* On the "Attract contributors..." side, I would suggest adding a box labeled:
"Create a profile to talk about your involvement" and linking somewhere. Where
to link? If you want to link to a sample profile, someone like willkg's profile
would be good.

* You wrote "volunteer opportunities finder" but in e.g.
<a href="https://openhatch.org/about/">https://openhatch.org/about/</a> we call it "volunteer opportunity finder".

The rest, if you agree, file bugs and target them not 0.11.02 and that's fine by me!</pre>

    <pre>re: exposing brokenness, yeah, that's part of why I decided to *just* do the
unlogged-in version for this milestone. If I'd done the logged-in one, I
would've wanted to include e.g. "X new people said they want to help with Y
project!" with a link to where you're supposed to contact them. Which doesn't
exist yet. :P

Which (if any) of the things you mentioned are blockers on this getting added,
and which can wait until next month?</pre>

    <pre>Wow, there's a lot of changes here. Some detailed feedback:

ktarnowski, do you want to take a look in terms of spacing?

Re-organizing the page this way exposes some of the problems with the site.
Maybe we can focus next month on "performance and basic improvements"...? Who knows.

Some things that came to mind:

* You point to the somewhat useless /+projects/ page. I guess that's the best
place to point, but maaan, that sure exposes the flaws with that page. You
should keep it that way, and we should fix /+projects/. (I kind of wonder if you
should link to a sample project page instead... but which one? Probably not
OpenHatch because that would be confusing.)

On the "Attract contributors..." side, I would suggest adding a box labeled:
"Create a profile to talk about your involvement" and linking somewhere. Where
to link? If you want to link to a sample profile, someone like willkg's profile
would be good.

There's some sense in which the text could use some sprucing up to really
suggest activity. Maybe linking to examples would help with that, but I don't
want to clutter everything up.

I wish that "Tell people who have clicked your project's 'I want to help' button
how they can contribute" could link to the projects that the person actually
works on. But I guess the user is not logged in yet.

You wrote "volunteer opportunities finder" but in e.g.
<a href="https://openhatch.org/about/">https://openhatch.org/about/</a> we call it "volunteer opportunity finder".

It looks really really good, as per the mockup. Also I really like how you
explain what bitesize means in "bitesize (easy)" on the "Contribute to..." view.

    <pre>I have a couple of suggestions regarding the design's:

* [ALL] Adding vertical space between elements should improve the general look 
and feel of the site. In particular between top navigation bar and OH tagline, OH 
tagline and tab widget, tab caption and its contents.

* [ALL] I think that the tabbed widget would look better with small border/rim 
around it, like 'Recent activity' or 'OpenHatch news' boxes. Right now it
s too bright.

* [ALL] Additionally to the above, adding small border/rim around the active tab 
itself might look really nice. Applying rounded corners might help as well.

* [MOCKUP-3] Adding some padding (yo!) between section header and border-bottom 
might look better. Try changing the color of the border-bottom to something from 
#888 - #eee.

* [MOCKUP-3] Recommended people section. Try to organize entries as follows:
  
         Width: ~50%   Some padding (&gt;20px?)             The rest

    <pre>Are you okay with iterating on this once every two-ish months? I think it makes
sense to focus the current design work on exposing the currently-good
functionality. I also think it's okay to not try really hard to expose the profile.

I think that the "Make your first contribution" and "Make your nth contribution"
are the same right now; even non-newbies could use training missions in e.g.
version control tools they don't know. Maybe call that heading "Make a
contribution to open source".

I think that "Attract contributors to your project" feels pretty fleshed-out, too.

I would be okay with skipping the "Help out" section for now, since it's kind of
weak. That's what I mean by iterating -- one day, maybe we'll have features that
make sense to fill up a section. But I actually do think that if we show people
how to help join/drive the OpenHatch project itself, then we'd have enough meat
there to justify a section. I think it would be a useful section, too. Plus we
can link people to the Events list.</pre>

    <pre>I guess 'Help others' could be subsumed under 'Attract contributors to your
project', though the implicit idea that people would be only interested in
mentoring so as to get people to work on their favored project seems a little
mercenary (if common).

'Profile' could be left out if the workflow for the rest of the site made it
eminently clear that bothering to fill the profile out makes using the rest of
the features possible/easier...

Anyway, I'd like to get this schema mostly hammered out before doing
mockups/actual redesigning... Seems like the more sensible order to do things.</pre>

    <pre>To me, it seems like there's more like five segments of needs / activities that
we could have tabs for:

* Make your first contribution
** Missions
** Find a mentor
** Project page Q&amp;As
** Volopps

* Make your nth contribution
** Project page Q&amp;As
** Volopps
** Events/organize a local hack session (via /+people/ (someday (?)))

* Attract contributors to your project
** Add info to your project page
** 'I wanna help' button
** Buildhelper (someday)
** Forums (someday)

* Help others
** Edit proj pages for projects you contribute to
** Project forums (someday)
** Mentoring

* Show off what you've done
** Profile

The last of these is pretty undeveloped, and some of the others rely rather
heavily on features that don't exist yet.

Is there any way to combine these under a heading that actually makes sense? If
we e.g. didn't have the profile listed or linked under any tab, would that be
okay or terrible?</pre>

    <pre>Through tabs at the top, you should be able to switch between these modes at will.

   1. "Make your first contribution" # (though how do we make this inclusive to
people who *have* contributed before?)
   2. "Attract contributors to your project"
   3. "Help make this website better" 

Each mode has information / a dashboard associated with it, e.g. "Attract
contributors" would have "X new people clicked the 'I wanna help' button! Go
here to respond..."

Arguably these modes should be thematically consistent between the logged-in and
not-logged-in versions of the landing page (the former just has personalized
data e.g. recommended bugs).

Of course, the proposed schema leaves out some things that are currently
featured on the home page, mainly "Tell your open source story". Is there a way
to include that feature in this schema? Or is it not worth featuring?

Also, do we really want to elevate OH dev to that level of prominence?</pre>
